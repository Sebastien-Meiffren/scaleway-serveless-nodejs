# Scaleway Boilerplate Function Serverless Nodejs14
Based on the information found : https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-functions-runtimes/tree/master/runtimes/node14

## Install
Make sure to have installed : 
- Nodejs (tested with 16.x)
- Docker (if you want to run it in a docker)
To install the system : 
- ``npm install``
- ``npm run build``
- ``npm run start``

⚠️I know there are some errors while building but the dist/index.js file is correct. I don't know if this is because scaleway uses node14 and I node16
## Build your functions
Create a new file in ``./handlers/src/foo.js``
You file should contain at the very least
```
module.exports.foohandle = (event, context, callback) => {
    return "OK"
}
```

## Tests your function
⚠️Make sure to restart the start process  
⚠️Once a function is used by the process, you won't be able to change it. This is due to the code from Scaleway and I'm limiting the changes. If you want to test another function, you will have to kill the process and start it again

💀💀 DO NOT USE THIS IN PROD. ONLY MEANT FOR TESTING / DEV PURPOSES 💀💀

To test your new function, query the app :   
``http://localhost:8081?handlerName=<FUNCTION NAME>&handlerPath=../handlers/src/<FUNCTION PATH>``

With our foo example, the query would be :  
``http://localhost:8081?handlerName=foohandle&handlerPath=../handlers/src/foo``


With the default handler :  
``http://localhost:8081?handlerName=handle&handlerPath=../handlers/src/handler``

## Deploy your functions
⚠️There is a second package.json file in the ``handlers`` directory to avoid packaging all dependencies for the project to run ⚠️

You need to configure the serverless.yml file : 
- NAMESPACE > namespace of your project.
- TOKEN FROM YOUR API > your API key https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/
- ID OF YOUR PROJECT > you project ID, can be found in the Scaleway homepage

After, just need to run ``serverless deploy``
